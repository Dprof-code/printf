# 0x11. C - printf

This is a collaboration project between [Adedamola Olawale](https://github.com/Dprof-code) and [Fashola Mueenat](https://github.com/mueenat) for the ALX Software Engineering program. This project aims to build a custom implementation of the C `printf` function. The `printf` function is responsible for formatted output in C, allowing various types of data to be printed with different formatting options.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a custom printf function, similar to the one defined in the C stdio.h library. The function should be able to take in various arguments and print formatted output to the console. The function will be implemented in C programming language.
