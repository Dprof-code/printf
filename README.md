# 0x11. C - printf

This is a collaboration project between [Adedamola Olawale](https://github.com/Dprof-code) and [Fashola Mueenat](https://github.com/mueenat) for the ALX Software Engineering program. This project aims to build a custom implementation of the C `printf` function. The `printf` function is responsible for formatted output in C, allowing various types of data to be printed with different formatting options.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to create a custom printf function, similar to the one defined in the C stdio.h library. The function should be able to take in various arguments and print formatted output to the console. The function will be implemented in C programming language.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `test/main.c`: The main program to test the `_printf` function.
- `_printf.c`: The implementation of the `my_printf` function.
- `main.h`: The header file containing function prototypes and any necessary macros or constants.
- There are several other helper functions(reusable functions) and functions for every of the printf function.

## How to Use

To build and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Dprof-code/printf.git`

2. Compile using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c ./test/main.c -o printf`

3. Run the executable:

`./printf`
